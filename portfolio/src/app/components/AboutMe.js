            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Ashley Trollinger, a passionate and dedicated software developer in the making.  My journey in software development began with a 6-month full-stack web development bootcamp at George Washington College, where I discovered my love for creating new and innovative app ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the bootcamp, I realized that my true interest lies in front-end development, where I can design sleek,
                clean, modern, and fun user interfaces with interactive components. I'm particularly fascinated by the
                possibilities of using AI to enhance user experiences and create intelligent, user-centric solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond my formal education, I'm constantly exploring and expanding my skills by working on personal projects.
                This not only keeps my skills fresh and up-to-date but also allows me to experiment with new technologies and
                stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.
            </p>
